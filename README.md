# Wine_Recommender

This repo contains a wine recommendation systems, build using Spark's implementation of Collaborative Filtering. 
The data is from Wine.com; because the company's data is private, the data has not been pushed to this repo, however the 
prediction and model validation results have been pushed and are available for viewing here. 

This project is my work for the capstone requirement of the GalvanizeU Data Science Master's Program. 
Galvanize and the University of New Haven have partnered up to create an industry focused data science 
master program. You can view the Student Experience video for GalvanizeU here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbJumvB5mX8
